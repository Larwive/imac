# iOS Mirroring Auto Clicker

This is meant to be an auto clicker tailored for iOS mirroring, featuring easy way to script touchscreen actions.


## Features
Supported actions:
- tap (coming soon)
- scroll (coming soon)
- multitap (if possible)

This app uses its own DSL (domain-specific language).


### Why not a general auto clicker ?

Since actions are limited, and there are already auto clickers around, this projects wants to be a convenient minimalist app.
